# Axum Tutorial For Beginners

Hello (future) web developers! This tutorial will cover how to write simple web applications in [rust] with [`axum`] framework. One of our goals in this tutorial is making it possible for a total rust and web beginner to learn coding with [rust] and [`axum`]. If you are a beginner, hopefully you will be comfortable.

We will do our best to explain [rust] language but reading [the book] is suggested.

If you are confused or having hard time understanding what is going on you can come to our [discord channel] and ask for help. You can also open an [issue].

## Tutorial

Sections below will teach stuff by example. Because only reading tons of pages is boring and will melt your brain.

To run examples you are going to need *a browser* and you need to [install rust] if you haven't already.
