# Basics

In this chapter, basics of axum web apps will be explained in a way that allows
you to use axum right away. (which we encourage you to do so you can learn even
faster) If you are just getting started with rust we do recommend that you start 
with the # [Rust Programming book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) or
if you prefer a PDF book you can take a look at # [The Rust Programming Language] (https://edu.anarcho-copy.org/Programming%20Languages/Rust/rust-programming-language-steve-klabnik.pdf).
Starting with these will make it much easier to understand most things we will
write into these tutorials.

Concepts explained here will be covered in detail in next chapters.
